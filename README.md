# Ardiuno-Metropoliton-Rail-Road-Traffic-System
This is an Arduino-based metropolitan road and road automated traffic system. It was my university's microprocessor &amp; Micro controller laboratory project
<br/>
Components used in the project:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Servo Motor
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. IR Sensor
5. LED
6. Wires
7. Buzzer

Problem Statement:  <br/>
All of us are aware of the traffic problems in Bangladesh. Our several hours of valuable time are being wasted in traffic jams. Now this is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh.
Along with it, there is a huge problem which is that our traffic controlling system isn’t smart enough. It can not determine which lane contains heavy traffic and needs to be realized
faster otherwise it will create gridlock. And which will create a huge suffering for people. We can also see, railways through the roads. So, it’s become very important to stop the vehicles
when the train is coming very near to the road. And the train needs to be notified that the way is clear to arrive. But this thing is done manually sometimes. And somewhere in our
country, the vehicles can not understand due to the delay in closing the rail gate. Our project is based on the solution of these problems.

Features:  <br/>
This is an Arduino-based Metropolitan Rail and Road Traffic System. This project focuses on designing and implementing an automated system that controls railway crossings
and road traffic lights in a metropolitan area. The system aims to provide real-time information, efficient management, and timely control of transportation infrastructure, contributing to
overall urban mobility.
1. Railway Crossing Automation<br/>
2. Railway Alarm System<br/>
3. Train Signal Light<br/>
4. Traffic Light System<br/>
5. Smart Traffic Light Timing<br/>
